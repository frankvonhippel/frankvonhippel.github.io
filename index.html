		<p id="NOJS">If you are reading this, it means you have Javascript disabled.  Cool!  There are plenty of good reasons to disable Javascript.  Maybe you are worried about your privacy, and do not want to be tracked by creepy ad-tech.  Maybe you want your web-pages to load more quickly.  Maybe you just think Javascript is a bummer and wish the world wide web ran on Haskell.  Maybe you just want to stick it to the man.  Whatever your reason, it is an unfortunate but universally accepted truth that this website will not work well without Javascript.  If you really insist on seeing this website without allowing Javascript to run over the internet, I suggest you set up a VM on an air-gapped machine, and just run the site locally.  Go wild!  Use Tails!  The code is open-source.  Check it out here: https://github.com/frankvonhippel/frankvonhippel.github.io/.  Also, you might want to think about the fact that HTML5 and CSS are both Turing-complete anyway ...</p>
