      							<i>The Chemical Age</i>: How chemists fought famine and disease, killed millions, and changed our relationship with the Earth.
      						</h4>
				            <p class="card-text">
				            	For thousands of years, we’ve found ways to scorch, scour, and sterilize our surroundings to make them safer. Sometimes these methods are wonderfully effective. Often, however, they come with catastrophic consequences—consequences that aren’t typically understood for generations.
	 							<br><br>
								<i>The Chemical Age</i> tells the captivating story of the scientists who waged war on famine and disease with chemistry. With depth and verve, Frank A. von Hippel explores humanity’s uneasy coexistence with pests, and how their existence, and the battles to exterminate them, have shaped our modern world. Beginning with the potato blight tragedy of the 1840s, which led scientists on an urgent mission to prevent famine using pesticides, von Hippel traces the history of pesticide use to the 1960s, when Rachel Carson’s <i>Silent Spring</i> revealed that those same chemicals were insidiously damaging our health and driving species toward extinction. Telling the story of these pesticides in vivid detail, von Hippel showcases the thrills and complex consequences of scientific discovery. He describes the invention of substances that could protect crops, the emergence of our understanding of the way diseases spread, the creation of chemicals used to kill pests and people, and, finally, how scientists turned those wartime chemicals on the landscape at a massive scale, prompting the vital environmental movement that continues today.
								<br><br>
								<i>The Chemical Age</i> is a dynamic, sweeping history that exposes how humankind’s affinity for pesticides made the modern world possible—while also threatening its essential fabric.

      							<i>Tinbergen’s Legacy in <b>Behaviour</b></i>: Sixty Years of Landmark Stickleback Papers
      						</h4>
				            <p class="card-text">
				            	In a flurry of post-war productivity, Niko Tinbergen re-established his lab in Leiden, wrote landmark papers and his famous book <i>The Study of Instinct</i>, and founded the journal <i>Behaviour</i> to serve the burgeoning field of ethology. Tinbergen and his senior assistant, Jan van Iersel, published their classic paper, "Displacement reactions in the three-spined stickleback," in the first issue of his new journal in 1948. 
				            	<br><br>
				            	Stickleback are now a powerful model in the fields of behavioural ecology, evolutionary biology, developmental genetics, and ecotoxicology - an extraordinary development for a small fish that began its modeling career among an enthusiastic core of Tinbergen students in the 1930s. From a series of clever experiments with painted model fish to the use of the sequenced genome to analyze the genetic basis of courtship, stickleback science progressed in leaps and bounds, often via seminal studies published in the pages of <i>Behaviour</i>. 
				            	<br><br>
								<i>Tinbergen’s Legacy in Behaviour</i> traces sixty years in the development of science using stickleback as a model, with 34 original articles covering topics ranging from homosexuality and cannibalism to genetics and speciation. Desmond Morris, Theo Bakker, Robert Wootton, Michael Bell, Tom Reimchen, Boyd Kynard, Harman Peeke, and Iain Barber provide fresh retrospectives on their republished works. Commentary by Frank von Hippel accompanies the articles and explains the roles they played in the frontiers of science as researchers falsified or expanded upon one another’s ideas.

      							 Discoveries in perchlorate ecotoxicology.
      						</h4>
				            <p class="card-text">
				            	Frank began a major research program on perchlorate ecotoxicology after assisting with the development of analytical techniques 
				            	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15221180/">Dodds et al. 2004</a>). 
				            	Working with his Ph.D. student Richard Bernhardt, Frank discovered the first case of an environmental contaminant (perchlorate) capable of masculinizing genotypic female fish into hermaphrodites 
				            	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16916028/">Bernhardt et al. 2006</a>). 
				            	Previously, all known cases of sexual disruption leading to hermaphrodites were of males feminized. This study was featured in headline stories of Science News, Environmental Health Perspectives, Environmental Health News, and various newspapers and public radio programs. Subsequent research on perchlorate led to significant discoveries in Frank’s lab on developmental disruption of reproductive behavior, swimming performance, gross morphological traits, bone, and thyroid

				            	Frank’s lab discovered the critical window during which perchlorate disrupts both sexual and thyroid development, and identified factors of gonadal dysgenesis for both males and females 
				            	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25865142/">Furin et al. 2015b</a>;

				            	His research group found that perchlorate masculinizes female fish by reducing primary germ cell number early in development, a finding relevant to human reproductive diseases

				            <p class="card-text">
				            	Frank and his students developed a Fisher’s linear discriminant function based on stickleback skull morphology to identify populations along the benthic (bottom feeding) - limnetic (zooplankton feeding) axis

				            	Classification scores correlated with trophic morphology traits, physical habitat variables, and the presence of invasive fish. This is the first study to develop such a mathematical tool for classifying fish and testing hypotheses along this trophic axis. This allowed Frank and his students to investigate the detailed trophic ecology of mercury in stickleback along this trophic axis, and to parse out effects due to percent benthic carbon vs. trophic position

      							 Discoveries in rapid evolution and speciation.
      						</h4>
				            <p class="card-text">
				            	Frank and his students have investigated the rapid formation of stickleback species pairs in newly created lakes and streams and the contributions of spatial and temporal isolation and life history variation in the maintenance of these sympatric species. Frank’s research group demonstrated that assortative mating, a critical behavioral process to speciation, can evolve in as little as 10 generations during the process of rapid ecological speciation 
				            	(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3464953/">Furin et al. 2012</a>). 
				            	The team developed a new study system on earthquake uplift islands in southcentral Alaska, where previously marine habitat was uplifted by the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake and new freshwater habitats formed; in these habitats, oceanic stickleback evolved over a few decades into freshwater stickleback 
				            	(<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02417.x">Gelmond et al. 2009</a>),

				            	(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039416/">Kimmel et al. 2012</a>). 
				            	This is now considered to be one of the fastest known evolution events in a wild vertebrate, and Frank and his collaborators showed that the process repeated itself in parallel on multiple islands and among watersheds on a single island 
				            	(e.g., <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/52/E7204">Lescak et al. 2015</a>; this paper was widely covered in the press).

				            	and showed that stickleback physiology evolves quickly in concert with morphology 
				            	(<a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70175081">Divino et al. 2016</a>).
