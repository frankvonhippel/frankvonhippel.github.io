      							<i>The Chemical Age</i>: How chemists fought famine and disease, killed millions, and changed our relationship with the Earth.
      						</h4>
				            <p class="card-text">
				            	For thousands of years, we’ve found ways to scorch, scour, and sterilize our surroundings to make them safer. Sometimes these methods are wonderfully effective. Often, however, they come with catastrophic consequences—consequences that aren’t typically understood for generations.
	 							<br><br>
								The Chemical Age tells the captivating story of the scientists who waged war on famine and disease with chemistry. With depth and verve, Frank A. von Hippel explores humanity’s uneasy coexistence with pests, and how their existence, and the battles to exterminate them, have shaped our modern world. Beginning with the potato blight tragedy of the 1840s, which led scientists on an urgent mission to prevent famine using pesticides, von Hippel traces the history of pesticide use to the 1960s, when Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring revealed that those same chemicals were insidiously damaging our health and driving species toward extinction. Telling the story of these pesticides in vivid detail, von Hippel showcases the thrills and complex consequences of scientific discovery. He describes the invention of substances that could protect crops, the emergence of our understanding of the way diseases spread, the creation of chemicals used to kill pests and people, and, finally, how scientists turned those wartime chemicals on the landscape at a massive scale, prompting the vital environmental movement that continues today.
								<br><br>
								The Chemical Age is a dynamic, sweeping history that exposes how humankind’s affinity for pesticides made the modern world possible—while also threatening its essential fabric.

      							<i>Tinbergen’s Legacy in <b>Behaviour</b></i>: Sixty Years of Landmark Stickleback Papers
      						</h4>
				            <p class="card-text">
				            	In a flurry of post-war productivity, Niko Tinbergen re-established his lab in Leiden, wrote landmark papers and his famous book <i>The Study of Instinct</i>, and founded the journal <i>Behaviour</i> to serve the burgeoning field of ethology. Tinbergen and his senior assistant, Jan van Iersel, published their classic paper, "Displacement reactions in the three-spined stickleback," in the first issue of his new journal in 1948. 
				            	<br><br>
				            	Stickleback are now a powerful model in the fields of behavioural ecology, evolutionary biology, developmental genetics, and ecotoxicology - an extraordinary development for a small fish that began its modeling career among an enthusiastic core of Tinbergen students in the 1930s. From a series of clever experiments with painted model fish to the use of the sequenced genome to analyze the genetic basis of courtship, stickleback science progressed in leaps and bounds, often via seminal studies published in the pages of <i>Behaviour</i>. 
				            	<br><br>
								<i>Tinbergen’s Legacy in Behaviour</i> traces sixty years in the development of science using stickleback as a model, with 34 original articles covering topics ranging from homosexuality and cannibalism to genetics and speciation. Desmond Morris, Theo Bakker, Robert Wootton, Michael Bell, Tom Reimchen, Boyd Kynard, Harman Peeke, and Iain Barber provide fresh retrospectives on their republished works. Commentary by Frank von Hippel accompanies the articles and explains the roles they played in the frontiers of science as researchers falsified or expanded upon one another’s ideas.

      						</h4>
				            <p class="card-text">
				            	Frank worked with students and collaborators to develop numerous analytical tools and biomarkers for the use of stickleback in ecotoxicology 
				            	(e.g., <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15221180/">Dodds et al. 2004</a>), 
				            	and more specifically in arctic ecotoxicology 
				            	(<a href="http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/issues/v17/n04/ddar2973.pdf">von Hippel et al., 2016</a>). 
				            	These tools allow researchers to use stickleback, which are ubiquitous in contaminated sites of the Arctic, as biosentinels and models for understanding mechanisms of toxicity. Similarly, Frank and his collaborators are developing tools for the use of wild marsupials as model organisms for the health effects of manganese exposure on sensitive wildlife on Groote Island, Australia. This includes work on contamination of air with respirable manganese particles, and bioaccumulation of manganese in the northern quoll, a carnivorous marsupial 
				            	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29096311/">Amir Abdul Nasir et al. 2018a</a>), as well as effects of manganese exposure on motor performance in quolls

				            <p class="card-text">
				            	Working with his Ph.D. student Richard Bernhardt, Frank discovered the first case of an environmental contaminant (perchlorate) capable of masculinizing genotypic female fish into hermaphrodites 
				            	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16916028/">Bernhardt et al. 2006</a>). 
				            	Previously, all known cases of sexual disruption leading to hermaphrodites were of males feminized. This study was featured in headline stories of 
				            	Science News, 
				            	<a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.114-a637a">Environmental Health Perspectives</a>,

				            	and various newspapers
				            	and public radio programs. Subsequent research on perchlorate led to significant discoveries in Frank’s lab on developmental disruption of reproductive behavior, swimming performance, gross morphological traits, bone, and thyroid

				            	Frank’s lab discovered the critical window during which perchlorate disrupts both sexual and thyroid development, and identified factors of gonadal dysgenesis for both males and females 
				            	(e.g., <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25865142/">Furin et al. 2015</a>). 
				            	His research group found that perchlorate masculinizes female fish by reducing primary germ cell number early in development, a finding relevant to human reproductive diseases 
				            	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27383240/">Petersen et al. 2016</a>). 
				            	The team also discovered that perchlorate may be an environmental obesogen, and that it induces non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the developing stickleback

				            	Frank and his students have investigated the rapid formation of stickleback species pairs in newly created lakes and streams and the contributions of spatial and temporal isolation and life history variation in the maintenance of these sympatric species. Frank’s research group demonstrated that assortative mating, a critical behavioral process to speciation, can evolve in as little as 10 generations during the process of rapid ecological speciation 
				            	(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3464953/">Furin et al. 2012</a>). 
				            	The team developed a new study system on earthquake uplift islands in southcentral Alaska, where previously marine habitat was uplifted by the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake and new freshwater habitats formed; in these habitats, oceanic stickleback evolved over a few decades into freshwater stickleback, with phenotypes evolving in parallel to those of stickleback in much older sites around the world 
				            	(e.g., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039416/">Kimmel et al. 2012</a>). 
				            	This is now considered to be one of the fastest known evolution events in a wild vertebrate, and Frank and his collaborators showed that the process repeated itself in parallel on multiple islands and among watersheds on a single island 
				            	(e.g., <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/52/E7204">Lescak et al. 2015</a>; 
				            	this paper was <a href="https://pnas.altmetric.com/details/4875982/news">widely covered in the press</a>). 
				            	The team also analyzed the genomic basis of such rapid evolutionary change 
				            	(<a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/209/3/921">Bassam et al. 2018</a>; 
				            	this paper was featured in Spotlight by the Genetics Society of America), 
				            	and showed that stickleback physiology evolves quickly in concert with morphology 
				            	(see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/frank.von hippel.1/bibliography/44654552/public">complete bibliography</a>). 
				            	A number of tools have emerged from this work that are proving valuable in Frank’s ecotoxicology investigations using stickleback.
